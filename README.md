# Zillow Clustering and Regression Project: What is driving the errors in Zestimates?
- By Jeff Akins

## Project Goal: To determine the drivers of error in the Zestimates
### Additional Goals:
- Data Acquisition: Data is collected from the codeup cloud database with an appropriate SQL query
- Data Prep: Column data types are appropriate for the data they contain
- Data Prep: Missing values are investigated and handled
- Data Prep: Outliers are investigated and handled
- Exploration: the interaction between independent variables and the target variable is explored using visualization and statistical testing
- Exploration: Clustering is used to explore the data. A conclusion, supported by statistical testing and visualization, is drawn on whether or not the clusters are helpful/useful. At least 3 combinations of features for clustering should be tried.
- Modeling: At least 4 different models are created and their performance is compared. One model is the distinct - combination of algorithm, hyperparameters, and features.
- Best practices on data splitting are followed
- The final notebook has a good title and the documentation within is sufficiently explanatory and of high quality
- Decisions and judment calls are made and explained/documented
- All python code is of high quality
